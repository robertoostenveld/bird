Title: Natural rewards, learning and risk-taking in psychopathy
Description: "Among the most extensively studied impairments observed in individuals\
  \ with psychopathy are those related to the disturbed processing of reward and punishment\
  \ in relation to different forms of learning and decision making. In general, research\
  \ shows deficient responding to (predictors of) punishment, especially when facing\
  \ a competing reward, as well as impaired learning and decision making following\
  \ reward. However, a possibly crucial limitation of these studies is that the experimental\
  \ rewards that were used may not have been ecologically valid, and consequently\
  \ not relevant or motivationally significant for participants with psychopathy,\
  \ particularly for those that were incarcerated. Therefore, in the current project\
  \ two experimental tasks were employed using individualized rewards and their subjective\
  \ values to study (1) passive avoidance and reversal learning (PasRev dataset),\
  \ and (2) risky decision making (WoF dataset) in offenders with and without psychopathy,\
  \ as well as healthy controls. The results showed that sufficient subjective value\
  \ of reward facilitates acquisition but not response reversal in psychopathic offenders.\
  \ However, although we did find psychopathic offenders to be guided more by pay-off\
  \ sizes than probabilities, we did not find any effects of subjective reward value\
  \ on overall risky decision making. These findings suggest that specific reinforcement\
  \ learning impairments often found in individuals with psychopathy can be reduced\
  \ with the use of personalized rewards.\r\n\r\nRaw data files of each individual\
  \ participant contain behavioral output from both experiments, either labeled PW\
  \ or WP, depending on the order in which the two tasks were administered (PasRev-WoF,\
  \ or WoF-PasRev). Data from each experimental task can be separated on different\
  \ tabs using the appropriate VBA script that is also provided (see session nr and\
  \ task order). For the PasRev dataset, raw EEG-data files of each individual participant\
  \ are provided for each of the three experimental runs separately. In addition,\
  \ spreadsheets with all behavioral and ERP data on which the reported analyses have\
  \ been conducted are provided for each task separately. For the main analyses, the\
  \ applied SPSS syntax is also provided."
