Title: Alpha modulation in younger and older adults during distracted encoding
Description: To successfully encode information into long-term memory, we need top-down
  control to focus our attention on target stimuli. This attentional focus is achieved
  by the modulation of sensory neuronal excitability through alpha power. Failure
  to modulate alpha power and to inhibit distracting information has been reported
  in older adults during attention and working memory tasks. Given that alpha power
  during encoding can predict subsequent memory performance, aberrant oscillatory
  modulations might play a role in age-related memory deficits. However, it is unknown
  whether there are age-related differences in memory performance or alpha modulation
  when encoding targets with distraction. Here we show that both older and younger
  adults are able to encode targets paired with distractors and that the level of
  alpha power modulation during encoding predicted recognition success. Even though
  older adults showed signs of higher distractibility, this did not harm their episodic
  memory for target information. Also, we demonstrate that older adults only modulated
  alpha power during high distraction, both by enhancing target processing and inhibiting
  distractor processing. These results indicate that both younger and older adults
  are able to employ the same inhibitory control mechanisms successfully, but that
  older adults fail to call upon these when distraction is minimal. The findings of
  this study give us more insight into the mechanisms involved in memory encoding
  across the lifespan.
