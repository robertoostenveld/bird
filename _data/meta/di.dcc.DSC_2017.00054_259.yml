Title: 'Effect of depth information on multiple - object tracking in three dimensions:
  a probabilistic perspective'
Description: Many daily situations require us to track multiple objects and people.
  This ability has traditionally been investigated in observers tracking objects in
  a plane. This simplification of reality does not address how observers track objects
  when targets move in three dimensions. Here, we study how observers track multiple
  objects in 2D and 3D while manipulating the average speed of the objects and the
  average distance between them. We show that performance declines as speed increases
  and distance decreases and that overall tracking accuracy is always higher in 3D
  than in 2D. The effects of distance and dimensionality interact to produce a more
  than additive improvement in performance during tracking in 3D compared to 2D. We
  propose an ideal observer model that uses the object dynamics and noisy observations
  to track the objects. This model provides a good fit to the data and explains the
  key findings of our experiment as originating from improved inference of object
  identity by adding the depth dimension.
