Title: Panoramic Uncertainty in Vertical Perception
Description: Judgments of the orientation of a visual line with respect to Earth vertical
  are affected by panoramic visual cues. This is illustrated by the rod-and-frame
  effect (RFE), the finding that the perceived orientation of a luminous rod is biased
  by the orientation of a surrounding squared frame. In this study, we tested how
  the uncertainty of frame orientation affects the RFE by asking upright or tilted
  participants to psychometrically judge the orientation of a briefly flashed rod
  contained within either a circular frame, a squared frame, or either of two intermediate
  frame forms, called squircles, presented in various orientations. Results showed
  a cyclical modulation of frame-induced bias across the range of the square and squircular
  frame orientations. The magnitude of this bias increased with increasing squaredness
  of the frame, as if the more unequivocal the orientation cues of the frame, the
  larger the reliance on them for rod orientation judgments. These findings are explained
  with a Bayesian optimal integration model in which participants flexibly weigh visual
  panoramic cues, depending on their orientation reliability, and non-visual cues
  in the perception of vertical.
