Title: Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Improves Reactive Response
  Inhibition in Healthy Volunteers
Description: Involvement of the cerebellum to non-motor related aspects of behavior
  is becoming increasingly clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role
  of the cerebellum in reactive and proactive behavioral control and interference.
  In a double-blind controlled within-subject design, 26 healthy volunteers underwent
  real and sham cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) while performing
  a go/no-go task and a delay discounting task. Results showed that the number of
  go/no-go commission errors was significantly lower during real as compared with
  sham cerebellar tDCS. No effects of tDCS were observed on delay discounting. Our
  findings provide further behavioral support for the involvement of the cerebellum
  in fast neural processes associated with response inhibition.
