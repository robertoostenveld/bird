Title: Late integration of vision and proprioception during perturbed reaches
Description: "Abstract\r\nThe motor system corrects rapidly, but selectively, for\
  \ perturbations to ongoing reaching movements, depending on the constraints of the\
  \ task. To account for such sophistication, it has been postulated that corrections\
  \ are based on an estimated limb state that integrates all sensory changes caused\
  \ by the perturbation, taking into account their processing delays. Here we asked\
  \ if information from different sensory modalities is integrated immediately, or\
  \ processed separately in the early phase of a response. We perturbed the estimated\
  \ state of the limb with both uni-modal and bi-modal visual and proprioceptive perturbations\
  \ without changing the actual limb state. For visual perturbations, a cursor representing\
  \ the hand was shifted to the left or the right relative to the true hand location.\
  \ For proprioceptive perturbations, the biceps or triceps muscles were vibrated,\
  \ which induced illusory limb state changes to the right or the left. In the bimodal\
  \ condition the perturbations to vision and proprioception were either congruent\
  \ or incongruent in their directions. Response latencies show that it takes ~100\
  \ ms longer to respond to unimodal visual perturbations than to unimodal proprioceptive\
  \ perturbations. Responses to bimodal perturbations show that it takes an additional\
  \ ~100 ms beyond the response to unimodal visual perturbations for inter-modal consistency\
  \ to impact the response. These results suggest that visual and proprioceptive signals\
  \ are initially processed separately for state estimation and only combined at the\
  \ level of the limb's motor output, instead of being immediately integrated into\
  \ a single state estimate of the limb."
