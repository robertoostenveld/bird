Title: Concurrent analysis of white matter bundles and grey matter networks in the
  chimpanzee
Description: "Understanding the phylogeny of the human brain requires an appreciation\
  \ of brain organization of our closest animal relatives.\r\nNeuroimaging tools such\
  \ as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow us to study whole-brain organization\
  \ in species which\r\ncan otherwise not be studied. Here, we used diffusion MRI\
  \ to reconstruct the connections of the cortical hemispheres of the\r\nchimpanzee.\
  \ This allowed us to perform an exploratory analysis of the grey matter structures\
  \ of the chimpanzee cerebral\r\ncortex and their underlying white matter connectivity\
  \ profiles. We identified a number of networks that strongly resemble\r\nthose found\
  \ in other primates, including the corticospinal system, limbic connections through\
  \ the cingulum bundle and fornix,\r\nand occipital–temporal and temporal–frontal\
  \ systems. Notably, chimpanzee temporal cortex showed a strong resemblance\r\nto\
  \ that of the human brain, providing some insight into the specialization of the\
  \ two species’ shared lineage."
