Title: From full calibration to zero training for a code-modulated visual evoked potentials
  brain computer interface
Description: "Objective. Typically, a brain computer interface (BCI) is calibrated\
  \ using user- and session-specific data because of the individual idiosyncrasies\
  \ and the non-stationary signal properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Therefore,\
  \ it is normal that BCIs undergo a time-consuming passive training stage that prevents\
  \ users from directly operating it. In this study, we systematically reduce the\
  \ training dataset in a step-wise fashion, to ultimately arrive at a calibration-free\
  \ method for a code-modulated visually evoked potentials (cVEP) based BCI to fully\
  \ eliminate the tedious training stage.\r\n\t\t\r\nApproach. In an extensive offline\
  \ analysis we compare our sophisticated encoding model with a traditional event-related\
  \ potential (ERP) technique. We calibrate the encoding model in a standard way,\
  \ with data limited to a single class while generalizing to all others, and without\
  \ any data. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of the zero-training cVEP\
  \ BCI in an online setting. \r\n\t\t\r\nMain results. By adopting the encoding model,\
  \ the training data can be reduced substantially, while maintaining both the classification\
  \ performance as well as the explained variance of the ERP method. More so, with\
  \ data of only a one class or even no data at all, it still shows excellent performance.\
  \ Besides, the zero-training cVEP BCI achieved high communication rates in an online\
  \ spelling task, proving its feasibility in practical use.\r\n\t\t\r\nSignificance.\
  \ To date this is the fastest zero-training cVEP BCI in the field, allowing high\
  \ communication speeds without calibration while using only a few non-invasive water-based\
  \ EEG electrodes. This allows to skip the training stage altogether and spent all\
  \ precious time on direct operation. This minimizes session time and opens up new\
  \ exciting directions to practical plug-and-play BCI. Fundamentally, these results\
  \ validate that the adopted neural encoding model compresses data into event-responses\
  \ without loss of explanatory power as compared to using full ERPs as template."
