Title: Mapping multiple principles of parietal-frontal cortical organization using
  functional connectivity
Description: Resting state functional connectivity has been promoted as a promising
  tool for creating cortical maps that show remarkable similarity to those established
  by invasive histological methods. While this tool has been largely used to identify
  and map cortical areas, its true potential in the context of studying connectional
  architecture and in conducting comparative neuroscience has remained unexplored.
  Here, we employ widely used resting state connectivity and data-driven clustering
  methods to extend this approach for the study of the organizational principles of
  the macaque parietal–frontal system. We show multiple, overlapping principles of
  organization, including a dissociation between dorsomedial and dorsolateral pathways
  and separate parietal–premotor and parietal–frontal pathways. These results demonstrate
  the suitability of this approach for understanding the complex organizational principles
  of the brain and for large-scale comparative neuroscience.
