Title: 'Prevention is better than cure: effects of errors on memory performance during
  spatial learning in healthy aging'
Description: "Background: Healthy aging is accompanied by a decline in learning ability\
  \ and memory capacity. One widely-studied method to improve learning outcome is\
  \ by reducing the occurrence of errors during learning (errorless learning; EL).\
  \ However, there is also evidence that committing errors during learning (trial-and-error\
  \ learning; TEL) may benefit memory performance. We argue that these inconsistent\
  \ findings could be driven by a lack of control over the error frequency in traditional\
  \ EL and TEL paradigms.\r\n\r\nAim: This study employed a spatial learning task\
  \ to study EL and TEL and to determine the impact of error frequency on memory recall\
  \ in healthy older adults (OA; N = 68) and young adults (YA; N = 60).\r\n\r\nMethod:\
  \ Four groups of participants (YA-EL, YA-TEL, OA-EL, OA-TEL) were instructed to\
  \ first place and memorize the locations of everyday objects in a chest of drawers\
  \ presented on a computer screen, and in whom memory recall performance was later\
  \ tested. In the TEL condition, the amount of errors made before the correct drawer\
  \ was 'found' was predetermined, varying from 0 to 5. During the EL condition, every\
  \ first attempt was correct (i.e., no errors were made).\r\n\r\nResults: We found\
  \ better overall performance in YA compared to OA and a beneficial effect of EL\
  \ in both age groups. However, the amount of errors committed during learning did\
  \ not influence accuracy of memory recall.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Our results indicate\
  \ that elimination of errors during learning can benefit memory performance in both\
  \ YA and OA compared to TEL."
