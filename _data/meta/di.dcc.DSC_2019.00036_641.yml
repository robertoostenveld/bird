Title: Errorless and trial-and-error learning of object locations in patients with
  executive deficits after brain injury
Description: Studies investigating the efficacy of errorless learning (EL), a rehabilitation
  method in which the occurrence of errors during learning are eliminated, have predominantly
  involved patients with memory impairment. However, the most recent perspective on
  the underlying mechanism of EL explicitly takes executive processes into account.
  The aim of this study was to investigate whether EL of object locations is beneficial
  for memory performance compared to trial-and-error learning (TEL) in patients with
  acquired brain injury (ABI) experiencing executive deficits (N = 15) and matched
  healthy controls (N = 15). Participants completed an EL and TEL condition of a computerized
  spatial learning task, in which the location of everyday objects had to be memorized.
  The number of errors made during learning was predetermined, varying from 0 (EL
  condition) to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 errors (TEL condition). Results showed a beneficial
  effect of EL on memory performance in both ABI patients and controls (p < .001),
  but this advantage was not larger in ABI patients compared to controls and was not
  moderated by the amount of errors made during learning.
