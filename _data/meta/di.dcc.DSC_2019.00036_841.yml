Title: 'Learning capacity in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease: The role of feedback
  during learning on memory performance'
Description: Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a decline in episodic memory
  and executive functioning, hampering learning ability. Insight into outcome-based
  learning capacity may be relevant for optimizing the learning potential of these
  patients. To date, mixed results have been found in studies in which cognitively
  impaired participants have to learn based on positive and negative outcomes. In
  this study, we investigated the role of negative and positive feedback on memory
  performance and participants’ ability to adjust their behavior accordingly in a
  sample of 23 early-stage AD patients and 23 matched healthy controls. We administered
  a novel computerized object-location memory task, in which participants were instructed
  to learn and memorize the locations of different everyday objects following errorless
  learning (EL) and trial-and-error learning (TEL). A separate probabilistic TEL task
  was employed in which participants had to learn how to adjust their behavior based
  on positive and negative feedback. EL had a beneficial general effect on memory
  performance for object locations. However, this effect was not larger in early-stage
  AD patients compared to controls and error frequency during acquisition of object
  locations was unrelated to later recall performance. No group differences in learning
  performance were found for the probabilistic learning task. Although the error monitoring
  system seems intact in patients with early-stage AD, errors during learning are
  likely acting as a source of interference causing difficulty in storage or retrieval
  of object locations.
