Title: Infants tailor their attention to maximize learning
Description: Infants’ remarkable learning abilities allow them to rapidly acquire
  many complex skills. It has been suggested that infants achieve this by optimally
  allocating their attention to relevant stimuli in the environment, but the underlying
  mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we modelled infants’ looking behavior
  during a learning task through an ideal learner that quantified the informational
  structure of environmental stimuli. We show that saccadic latencies, looking time,
  and time spent engaged with a stimulus sequence are explained by the properties
  of the learning environments, including the stimulus surprise, the overall predictability
  of the environment, and the progress in learning the environmental structure. These
  findings reveal the factors that shape infants’ advanced learning, emphasizing their
  predisposition to seek out stimuli that maximize learning.
