Title: PBB - Diffusion MRI
Description: Large-scale comparative neuroscience requires data from many species
  and, ideally, at multiple levels of description. Here, we contribute to this endeavor
  by presenting diffusion and structural MRI data from eight primate species that
  have not or rarely been described in the literature. The selected samples from the
  Primate Brain Bank cover a prosimian, New and Old World monkeys, and a great ape.
  We present preliminary labelling of the cortical sulci and tractography of the optic
  radiation, dorsal part of the cingulum bundle, and dorsal parietal-frontal and ventral
  temporal-frontal longitudinal white matter tracts. Both dorsal and ventral association
  fiber systems could be observed in all samples, with the dorsal tracts occupying
  much less relative volume in the prosimian than in other species. We discuss the
  results in the context of known primate specializations and present hypotheses for
  further research. All data and results are presented here and available online as
  a resource for the scientific community.
