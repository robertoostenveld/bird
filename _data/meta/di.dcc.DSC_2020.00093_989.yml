Title: Goal-directed recruitment of Pavlovian biases through selective visual attention
Description: 'Prospective outcomes bias behavior in a “Pavlovian” manner: Reward prospect
  invigorates action, while punishment prospect suppresses it. Theories have posited
  Pavlovian biases as global action “priors” in unfamiliar or uncontrollable environments.
  However, this account fails to explain the strength of these biases—causing frequent
  action slips—even in well-known environments. We propose that Pavlovian control
  is additionally useful if flexibly recruited by instrumental control. Specifically,
  instrumental action plans might shape selective attention to reward/ punishment
  information and thus the input to Pavlovian control. In two eye-tracking samples
  (N = 35/ 64), we observed that Go/ NoGo action plans influenced when and for how
  long participants attended to reward/ punishment information, which in turn biased
  their responses in a Pavlovian manner. Participants with stronger attentional effects
  showed higher performance. Thus, humans appear to align Pavlovian control with their
  instrumental action plans, extending its role beyond action defaults to a powerful
  tool ensuring robust action execution.'
