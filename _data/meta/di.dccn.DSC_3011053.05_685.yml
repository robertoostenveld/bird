Title: 'Magic moments: New word learning in children'
Description: 'Memory representations of words are thought to undergo changes with
  consolidation: Episodic memories of novel words are transformed into lexical representations
  that interact with other words in the mental dictionary. Behavioral studies have
  shown that this lexical integration process is enhanced when there is more time
  for consolidation. Neuroimaging studies have further revealed that novel word representations
  are initially represented in a hippocampally-centered system, whereas left posterior
  middle temporal cortex activation increases with lexicalization. In this study,
  we measured behavioral and brain responses to newly-learned words in children. Two
  groups of Dutch children, aged between 8–10 and 14–16 years, were trained on 30
  novel Japanese words depicting novel concepts. Children were tested on word-forms,
  word-meanings, and the novel words’ influence on existing word processing immediately
  after training, and again after a week. In line with the adult findings, hippocampal
  involvement decreased with time. Lexical integration, however, was not observed
  immediately or after a week, neither behaviorally nor neurally. It appears that
  time alone is not always sufficient for lexical integration to occur. We suggest
  that other factors (e.g., the novelty of the concepts and familiarity with the language
  the words are derived from) might also influence the integration process.'
