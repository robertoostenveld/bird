Title: Distracting Linguistic Information Impairs Neural Tracking of Attended Speech
Description: Listening to speech is difficult in noisy environments, and is even harder
  when the interfering noise consists of intelligible speech as compared to unintelligible
  sounds. This suggests that the competing linguistic information interferes with
  the neural processing of target speech. Interference could either arise from a degradation
  of the neural representation of the target speech, or from increased representation
  of distracting speech that enters in competition with the target speech. We tested
  these alternative hypotheses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants
  listened to a target clear speech in the presence of distracting noise-vocoded speech.
  Crucially, the distractors were initially unintelligible but became more intelligible
  after a short training session. Results showed that the comprehension of the target
  speech was poorer after training than before training. The neural tracking of target
  speech in the delta range (1–4 Hz) reduced in strength in the presence of a more
  intelligible distractor. In contrast, the neural tracking of distracting signals
  was not significantly modulated by intelligibility. These results suggest that the
  presence of distracting speech signals degrades the linguistic representation of
  target speech carried by delta oscillations.
