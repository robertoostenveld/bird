Title: Integrated analysis of anatomical and electrophysiological human intracranial
  data
Description: "The exquisite spatiotemporal precision of human intracranial EEG recordings\
  \ (iEEG) permits characterizing neural processing with a level of detail that is\
  \ inaccessible to scalp-EEG, MEG, or fMRI.  However, the same qualities that make\
  \ iEEG an exceptionally powerful tool also present unique challenges.  Until now,\
  \ the fusion of anatomical data (MRI and CT images) with the electrophysiological\
  \ data and its subsequent analysis has relied on technologically and conceptually\
  \ challenging combinations of software.  Here, we describe a comprehensive protocol\
  \ that addresses the complexities associated with human iEEG, providing complete\
  \ transparency and flexibility in the evolution of raw data into illustrative representations.\
  \  The protocol is directly integrated with an open source toolbox for electrophysiological\
  \ data analysis (FieldTrip).  This allows iEEG researchers to build on a continuously\
  \ growing body of scriptable and reproducible analysis methods that, over the past\
  \ decade, have been developed and employed by a large research community.  We demonstrate\
  \ the protocol for an example complex iEEG data set to provide an intuitive and\
  \ rapid approach to dealing with both neuroanatomical information and large electrophysiological\
  \ data sets.  We explain how the protocol can be largely automated and readily adjusted\
  \ to iEEG data sets with other characteristics.  The protocol can be implemented\
  \ by a graduate student or post-doctoral fellow with minimal MATLAB experience and\
  \ takes approximately an hour, excluding the automated cortical surface extraction.\r\
  \n\r\nThis collection contains the data described in the protocol and that can be\
  \ used to replicate all results."
