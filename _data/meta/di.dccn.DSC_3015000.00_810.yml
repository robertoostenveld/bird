Title: Characterization of auditory steady state brain responses in time, frequency
  and space
Description: "The auditory steady state evoked response (ASSR) is a robust and frequently\
  \ utilized phenomenon in psychophysiological research. It reflects the auditory\
  \ cortex excitability as a response of a frequency modulated auditory stimulus.\
  \ The present report aims to provide an example of a group analysis in 29 healthy\
  \ human participants in the context of an ASSR paradigm. First, analysis in the\
  \ time domain will demonstrate descriptive evaluation and statistical control of\
  \ auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Second, frequency analysis is applied\
  \ to describe the spectral characteristics of these ERPs followed by group level\
  \ statistics in the frequency domain. Third, time and frequency domain data approaches\
  \ are combined in order to describe the temporal and spectral development of the\
  \ ASSR. Finally, an example of analysis in source space is applied in order to characterize\
  \ the primary neural generators of the ASSR response.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains\
  \ all data and analysis scripts to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript."
