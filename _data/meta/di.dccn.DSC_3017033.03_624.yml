Title: Frontal network dynamics reflect neurocomputational mechanisms for reducing
  maladaptive biases in motivated action
Description: Motivation exerts control over behavior by eliciting Pavlovian responses,
  which can either match or conflict with instrumental action. We can overcome maladaptive
  motivational influences, putatively through frontal cognitive control. However,
  the neurocomputational mechanisms subserving this control are unclear; does control
  entail upregulating instrumental systems, downregulating Pavlovian systems, or both?
  We combined EEG recordings with a motivational Go/NoGo learning task (N=34), where
  multiple Go options enabled us to disentangle selective action learning from non-selective
  Pavlovian responses. Midfrontal theta-band (4-8Hz) activity covaried with the level
  of Pavlovian conflict, and was associated with reduced Pavlovian biases, rather
  than reduced instrumental learning biases. Motor and lateral prefrontal regions
  synchronized to the midfrontal cortex, and these network dynamics predicted the
  reduction of Pavlovian biases over and above local, midfrontal theta activity. This
  work links midfrontal processing to detecting Pavlovian conflict, and highlights
  the importance of network processing in reducing the impact of maladaptive, Pavlovian
  biases.
