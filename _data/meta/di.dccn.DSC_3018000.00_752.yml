Title: A hierarchy of linguistic predictions during natural language comprehension
Description: Understanding spoken language requires transforming ambiguous acoustic
  streams into a hierarchy of representations, from phonemes to meaning. It has been
  suggested that the brain uses prediction to guide the interpretation of incoming
  input. However, the role of prediction in language processing remains disputed,
  with disagreement about both the ubiquity and representational nature of predictions.
  Here, we address both issues by analysing brain recordings of participants listening
  to audiobooks, and using a deep neural network (GPT-2) to precisely quantify contextual
  predictions.  First, we establish that brain responses to words are modulated by
  ubiquitous, probabilistic predictions.  Next, we disentangle model-based predictions
  into distinct dimensions, revealing dissociable signatures of syntactic, phonemic
  and semantic predictions. Finally, we show that high-level (word) predictions inform
  low-level (phoneme) predictions, supporting hierarchical predictive processing.
  Together, these results underscore the ubiquity of prediction in language processing,
  showing that the brain spontaneously predicts upcoming language at multiple levels
  of abstraction.
