Title: Adaptation and serial choice bias for low-level visual features are unaltered
  in autistic adolescents
Description: 'Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or autism is characterized by social
  and non-social symptoms, including sensory hyper- and hyposensitivities. A suggestion
  has been put forward that some of these symptoms could be explained by differences
  in how sensory information is integrated with its context, including a lower tendency
  to leverage the past in the processing of new perceptual input. At least two history-dependent
  effects of opposite directions have been described in the visual perception literature:
  a repulsive adaptation effect, where perception of a stimulus is biased away from
  an adaptor stimulus, and an attractive serial choice bias, where perceptual choices
  are biased towards the previous choice. In this study, we investigated whether autistic
  participants differed in either bias from typically developing controls (TD). Sixty-four
  adolescent participants (31 with ASD, 33 TD) were asked to categorize oriented line
  stimuli in two tasks which were designed so that we would induce either adaptation
  or serial choice bias. Although our tasks successfully induced both biases, in comparing
  the two groups, we found no differences in the magnitude of adaptation nor in the
  modulation of perceptual choices by the previous choice. In conclusion, we find
  no evidence of a decreased integration of the past in visual perception of low-level
  stimulus features in autistic adolescents.'
