Title: Opposite effects of choice history and evidence history resolve a paradox of
  sequential choice bias
Description: Perceptual decisions are biased towards previous decisions. Previous
  research suggests that this choice repetition bias is increased after previous decisions
  of high confidence, as inferred from response time measures (Urai et al., 2017),
  but also when previous decisions were based on weak sensory evidence (Akaishi et
  al., 2014). As weak sensory evidence is typically associated with low confidence,
  these previous findings appear conflicting. To resolve this conflict, we set out
  to investigate the effect of decision confidence on choice repetition more directly
  by measuring explicit confidence ratings in a motion coherence discrimination task.
  Moreover, we explored how choice and evidence history jointly affect subsequent
  perceptual choices. We found that participants were more likely to repeat previous
  choices of high subjective confidence, as well as previous fast choices, confirming
  the boost of choice repetition with decision confidence. Furthermore, we discovered
  that current choices were biased away from the previous evidence direction, and
  that this effect grew with previous evidence strength. These findings point towards
  simultaneous biases of choice repetition, modulated by decision confidence, and
  evidence adaptation, modulated by the strength of evidence, which bias current perceptual
  decisions in opposite directions.
