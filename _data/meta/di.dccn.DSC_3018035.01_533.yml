Title: Predictable tones elicit stimulus-specific suppression of evoked activity in
  auditory cortex
Description: The auditory cortex is sensitive to many forms of acoustic regularity,
  resulting in suppressed neural activity for expected auditory events. It is unclear
  whether this activity reduction for expected events is the result of suppression
  of neurons that are tuned to the expected stimulus (i.e., dampening), or alternatively
  suppression of neurons that are tuned away from the expected stimulus (i.e., sharpening).
  In the present study, we adjudicated between these models by characterizing the
  effect of expectation on the ability to classify the identity of auditory stimuli
  from auditory neural activity patterns, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy
  human observers. Participants listened to pure tone pairs, in which the identity
  of the second tone was either expected or unexpected. The task of the participants
  was to detect a target tone, which deviated strongly from both the expected and
  unexpected tones. We found a strong suppression of the overall neural response in
  the expected condition compared to the unexpected condition. Linear classifiers
  showed a reduced ability to decode stimulus identity from event-related auditory
  fields in the expected condition compared to the unexpected condition. This suggests
  that stimulus-specific event-related activity is dampened for expected tones in
  auditory cortex.â€ƒ
