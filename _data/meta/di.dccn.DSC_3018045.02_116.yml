Title: Tracking predictions in naturalistic music listening using MEG and computational
  models of music
Description: "This is the dataset acquired for the 2022 study by Kern, Heilbron, De\
  \ Lange, & Spaak. Licensed CC-BY-4.0, to comply with attribution terms, please cite\

  \ for the preprint describing the study below:\r\n\r\nExpectations shape our experience\
  \ of music. However, the internal model upon which listeners form melodic expectations\
  \ is still debated. Do expectations stem from Gestalt-like principles or statistical\
  \ learning? If the latter, does long-term experience play an important role, or\
  \ are short-term regularities sufficient? And finally, what length of context informs\
  \ contextual expectations? To answer these questions, we presented human listeners\
  \ with diverse naturalistic compositions from Western classical music, while recording\
  \ neural activity using MEG. We quantified note-level melodic surprise and uncertainty\
  \ using various computational models of music, including a state-of-the-art transformer\
  \ neural network. A time-resolved regression analysis revealed that neural activity\
  \ over fronto-temporal sensors tracked melodic surprise particularly around 200\
  \ ms and 300-500 ms after note onset. This neural surprise response was dissociated\
  \ from sensory-acoustic and adaptation effects. Neural surprise was best predicted\
  \ by computational models that incorporated long-term statistical learning - rather\
  \ than by simple, Gestalt-like principles. Yet, intriguingly, the surprise reflected\
  \ primarily short-range musical contexts of less than ten notes. We present a full\
  \ replication of our novel MEG results in an openly available EEG dataset. Together,\
  \ these results elucidate the internal model that shapes melodic predictions during\
  \ naturalistic music listening."
