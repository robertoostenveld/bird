Title: Useful field of view test performance throughout adulthood in subjects without
  ocular disorders.
Description: Previous research has shown an age-related decline in Useful Field of
  View (UFOV) test performance, which measures the duration required to extract relevant
  information from a scene in three subtasks. However, these results are mostly based
  on data that may have been confounded by (age-related) ocular diseases. We examined
  UFOV performance in subjects aged 19.5 to 70.3 years to investigate how UFOV performance
  changes throughout adulthood. All subjects underwent a thorough ophthalmological
  examination to exclude ocular disorders. We also examined some elementary visual
  functions, i.e., near and far visual acuity, crowding and contrast sensitivity.
  We investigated whether these functions were related to age and whether they could
  explain a possible age-related decline in UFOV performance. The subjects (n = 41)
  performed very well on almost every measure and reached far better UFOV and visual
  acuity scores than those reported by other studies that relied on self-reported
  absence of ocular pathology. We did not find significant relationships between age
  and any of the elementary visual functions or the first two UFOV subtasks. However,
  we found an age-related decline in performance on the third UFOV subtask, which
  was unrelated to performance on the elementary visual function tasks. Our results
  show that performance on the first two UFOV subtasks as well as central elementary
  visual functions may remain high in the absence of obvious ophthalmological pathology.
