Title: The effect of doorway characteristics on freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease
Description: |-
  This dataset includes the results of a two-part survey on freezing of gait at doorways.

  Part I (n=288) could be filled out by anyone with freezing of gait, and inquires about general disease and demographic characteristics, as well as the Dutch version of the New-Freezing of Gait questionnaire (Nieuwboer et al., 2009) with added questions regarding doorway freezing, and an adapted, Dutch translation of the Gait-Specific Attention Profile (Young et al., 2020) that inquires about different mental processes when walking through doorways.

  Part II (n=68) could be filled out by anyone with freezing at doorways at least once per week, and inquires about the effect of 32 doorway characteristics on freezing at doorways.

  Data from participants who did not agree to data sharing were removed from the dataset.

  In order to ensure participants' anonymity, age was adapted to represent an age range, rather than a specific age. If answers to the open questions contained any identifiable data such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, disease-related details or details describing participants' home environment, these parts of the answer were removed from the dataset.
