Title: Hearing asymmetry biases spatial hearing in bimodal cochlear-implant users
  despite bilateral low-frequency hearing preservation
Description: Many cochlear implant users with binaural residual (acoustic) hearing
  benefit from combining electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) in the implanted
  ear with acoustic amplification in the other. These bimodal EAS listeners can potentially
  use low-frequency binaural cues to localize sounds. However, their hearing is generally
  asymmetric for mid- and high-frequency sounds, perturbing or even abolishing binaural
  cues. Here, we investigated the effect of a frequency-dependent binaural asymmetry
  in hearing thresholds on sound localization by seven bimodal EAS listeners. Frequency
  dependence was probed by presenting sounds with power in low-, mid-, high- or mid-to-high-frequency
  bands. Frequency-dependent hearing asymmetry was present in the bimodal EAS listening
  condition (when using both devices) but was also induced by independently switching
  devices on or off. Using both devices, hearing was near symmetric for low frequencies,
  asymmetric for mid frequencies with better hearing thresholds in the implanted ear,
  and monaural for high frequencies with no hearing in the non-implanted ear. Sound-localization
  performance was poor in general. Typically, localization was strongly biased toward
  the better hearing ear with some preference to localize toward the ear using the
  hearing aid. Only two listeners with little hearing asymmetry could localize low-
  and mid-frequency sounds reasonably well with negligible bias using both devices.
  The results suggest that hearing asymmetry in bimodal EAS listeners leads to persistent
  localization biases. We discuss how frequency dependence of any hearing asymmetry
  may lead to binaural cues that are spatially inconsistent as the spectrum of a sound
  changes. We speculate that this inconsistency may prevent accurate sound-localization
  even after long-term exposure to the hearing asymmetry.
