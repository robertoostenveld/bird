Title: Cortical representation of touch in silico
Description: "This repository contains 10 realizations of calculations of connectivity\
  \ structures for a model somatosensory (barrel) cortical column (thalamus, L4 and\
  \ L2/3, see corresponding code and article). There are 5 realizations for a 1-column\
  \ (1 barrel) networks, and 5 for a 3 column (3 barrels) network. The code to generate\
  \ this model can be found on github (see url below).\r\n\r\nThe model is a biologically\
  \ inspired, computationally efficient network model of somatosensory cortical columns.\
  \ It was created by (1) reconstructing the barrel cortex in soma resolution using\
  \ multi-channel mosaic scanning confocal microscopy, (2) defining a mathematical\
  \ model (Izhikevich model) of cortical neurons whose action potential threshold\
  \ adapts to the rate of ongoing network activity impinging onto the postsynaptic\
  \ neuron and (3) connecting each neuron in the network using statistical rules of\
  \ pair-wise connectivity based on experimental observations. The input consists\
  \ of whisker data (here: angle and curvature, but other metrics such as deviation\
  \ from baseline are also possible). Based on this, thalamic spike trains are generated\
  \ (thalamic neurons are considered simple filter-and-fire Poisson neurons), that\
  \ then form the input to the cortical model.\r\n\r\nThe following files are included\
  \ in each subfolder:\r\n* cellinfo: information about all cells: (Number of Cells-by\
  \ 6, note that L4 cells come first, followed by L23 cells) matrix, see github for\
  \ further explanation)\r\n* CMDMs: all connectivity data\r\n* CMDMs_(…)_ConData\r\
  \n* CMDMs_(…)_ParaMat\r\n* CMDMs_(…)_ParaMat_reduced: a reduced version of the previous\
  \ set, to speed up simulations\r\n* CMDMs_(…)_WhiskerModulationModel: the model\
  \ for the direct modulation by motor cortex [3]\r\n\r\nNB Note that the measured\
  \ cell densities are in mice, but most axon/dendritic distribution patterns, connectivity\
  \ and synaptic efficacy in the literature are from rats. To make these fit, the\
  \ measured cell densities were scaled to fit rat data. So the resulting cell locations\
  \ are appropriate for rat. Note that once the connectivity data are generated, these\
  \ cell locations are not used in the network simulations (as neurons are simulated\
  \ as point neurons)."
