Title: Ultrasonic vocal interaction resolved with millimeter precision using hybrid
  beamforming
Description: "Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) fulfill an important role in communication\
  \ and navigation in many species. Because of their social and affective significance,\
  \ rodent USVs are increasingly used as a behavioral measure in neurodevelopmental\
  \ and neurolinguistic research. Reliably attributing USVs to their emitter during\
  \ close interactions has emerged as a difficult, key challenge. If addressed, all\
  \ subsequent analyses gain substantial confidence.\nWe present a hybrid ultrasonic\
  \ tracking system, HyVL, that synergistically integrates a high-resolution acoustic\
  \ camera with high-quality ultrasonic microphones. HyVL is the first to achieve\
  \ millimeter precision (~3.4-4.8mm, 91% assigned) in localizing USVs, ~3x better\
  \ than other systems, approaching the physical limits (mouse snout ~ 10mm). \nWe\
  \ analyze mouse courtship interactions and demonstrate that males and females vocalize\
  \ in starkly different relative spatial positions, and that the fraction of female\
  \ vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization.\
  \ Further, we find that when two male mice interact with one female, one of the\
  \ males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization\
  \ rate and the location relative to the female. \nHyVL substantially improves the\
  \ precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied. It is\
  \ also affordable, open-source, easy to set up, can be integrated with existing\
  \ setups, and reduces the required number of experiments and animals."
