Title: The role of psychopathic traits, social anxiety and cortisol in social approach
  avoidance tendencies
Description: Social anxiety and psychopathy have conceptually been linked to nearly
  opposite emotional, behavioral and endocrinological endophenotypes, representing
  social fearfulness and fearlessness, respectively. Although such a dimensional view
  has theoretical and practical implications, no study has directly compared social
  anxiety and psychopathy in terms of emotional experiences, relevant hormones (i.e.
  cortisol, testosterone) and behavioral tendencies (i.e. social approach-avoidance).
  Therefore, the present study examined 1) whether self-reported social anxiety and
  psychopathic traits are indeed anticorrelated, and 2) whether social anxiety, psychopathic
  traits, cortisol, testosterone and their interplay are differentially linked to
  social approach-avoidance tendencies. In a well-powered study, a sample of 196 healthy
  female participants, we assessed self-reported emotional and behavioral tendencies
  of social fear (i.e. social anxiety and social avoidance) and psychopathic traits
  (i.e. Factor I [interpersonal-affective deficit] and Factor II [impulsive behavior]).
  Furthermore, hormone levels were assessed, and approach-avoidance tendencies towards
  emotional (angry, happy) facial expressions were measured by means of a joystick
  reaction time task. Results confirmed that self-reported emotional tendencies of
  social anxiety and psychopathy Factor I (interpersonal-affective deficit) correlated
  negatively, but self-reported behavioral tendencies (social avoidance and psychopathy
  Factor II [impulsive behavior]) correlated positively. Furthermore, Structural Equation
  Modelling demonstrated that participants with higher social anxiety and higher cortisol
  levels showed an avoidance tendency towards happy faces, while participants with
  higher psychopathic traits showed an approach tendency towards angry faces. In sum,
  the notion that social anxiety and psychopathic traits are opposing ends of one
  dimension was supported only in terms of self-reported emotional experiences, but
  a comparable relationship with regard to behavioral and endocrinological aspects
  is debatable. The current findings stress the necessity to study emotional, endocrinological
  and behavioral factors in unison in order to better understand the shared and distinctive
  mechanisms of social anxiety and psychopathic traits.
