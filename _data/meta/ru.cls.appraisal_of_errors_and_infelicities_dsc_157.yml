Title: Appraisal of errors and infelicities produced by Dutch learners of German
Description: "Responses to questionnaire in German by  by German professionals [Germany;\
  \ Spring 2016; qualtrics survey]\r\nAbstract\r\nOne of the new scales in the CEFR\
  \ Companion Volume (2018) is online interaction. The new descriptors cover goal-oriented\
  \ online transactions, including written correspondence and the use of formulaic\
  \ language. Dutch learners of German in business schools learn German for special\
  \ purposes at B1/2-level: they are requested to master German well enough in a professional\
  \ context, in order to facilitate interactions and transactions. The question is\
  \ how their not always flawless attempts at inviting a member to a meeting is received\
  \ by L1 language users. Is the level of B1/2 German sufficient to avoid bothersome\
  \ situations? Is the mastering at B1/2-level enough to maintain a good relationship\
  \ with a German partner? In order to find out whether communicative clashes might\
  \ occur because of lack of appropriate language, 98 German business professionals,\
  \ all L1 speakers of German, were asked to rate on a 7-point Likert scale pragma-linguistic\
  \ infelicities and syntactic, lexical and morphological errors in 16 business e-mails\
  \ written by Dutch learners of German. The results showed that pragma-linguistic\
  \ infelicities were considered more bothersome than syntactic, lexical or morphological\
  \ errors, which suggests L2 German writing courses should raise more explicit awareness\
  \ of the pragma-linguistic force in intercultural communication, in line with suggestions\
  \ of the new companion. Furthermore, it was studied whether knowledge of the writer’\
  s foreign provenance and Dutch nationality affected the judgement of the German\
  \ professionals. This was not the case.\r\nKeywords: \r\nSecond language acquisition,\
  \ error, pragma-linguistic infelicity, German, written interaction\r\n\r\nData are\
  \ used for contribution to Language Awareness, to be published in 2022; title: The\
  \ Importance of Raising Teachers’ and Students’ Awareness of Pragmatics\r\nin German\
  \ Second Language Writing: A Study of the Effect of Grammatical and Lexical Errors\
  \ Compared to pragma-linguistic Infelicities\r\nAuthors: Antoinette Luijkx, Marinel\
