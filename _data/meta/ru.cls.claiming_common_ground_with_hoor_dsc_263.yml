Title: Claiming common ground with 'hoor'
Description: In this article we conduct a pragmatic analysis of the Dutch utterance-final
  particle hoor (lit. ‘hear’). Apparently, hoor has contradictory uses. It expresses
  politeness (involvement, togetherness), but it can also contribute to the face-threatening
  force of an utterance. We argue that there is a core meaning that all uses share,
  which is that by adding hoor, speakers claim a proposition at issue to be part of
  the common ground. This core meaning will be shown to account for hoor’s key characteristics.
  Hoor expresses involvement and is often attached to speech acts that are intrinsically
  polite, such as apologizing and giving compliments. Also, while hoor never occurs
  in interrogative sentences, it can be used with a certain type of directive speech
  acts, namely those that are in the interest of the hearer or are presented as having
  shared interests.
