Title: Creo que or pienso que?
Description: This paper reports on an experimental production study of two Spanish
  markers of epistemic modality and evidentiality, creo que ‘I believe that’ and pienso
  que ‘I think that’, by native speakers, and by Dutch and German learners of Spanish.
  We found a clear preference for creo que among the native speakers of Spanish, but
  with differences between the main varieties of the language. For Dutch and German
  learners the preference for creo que was significantly weaker, and for beginning
  learners of Spanish it was significantly weaker than for advanced learners. While
  for the Dutch learners of Spanish this pattern reflects the preference for I think
  over I believe in their L1, the preference that the German-speaking learners have
  for creo que can be seen as evidence for a general tendency noticed in the literature,
  namely the interference of an L2 (in this case English) instead of the L1 (in this
  case German) in L3 performance (in this case Spanish).
