Title: Engagement with Narrative Characters Data Set
Description: "This data set consists of various data related to individual differences\
  \ in social-cognitive abilities (self-reported trait empathy, emotional empathy,\
  \ spontaneous mentalizing tendencies), self-reported experiences of character engagement\
  \ during narrative reading, and measures of reading habits (print exposure, reading\
  \ habits) from 349 native speakers of Dutch who read two narratives that were manipulated\
  \ for the presence of viewpoint markers. A pre-test was conducted to check the narrative\
  \ stimuli. This data is also included in this data set. \r\n\r\nThese data were\
  \ collected to study the relationship between social-cognitive abilities, the presence\
  \ of viewpoint markers, and experiences of character engagement, in the context\
  \ of PhD research by Lynn Eekhof, at the Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University."
