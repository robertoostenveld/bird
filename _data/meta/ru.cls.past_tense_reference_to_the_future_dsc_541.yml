Title: Past tense reference to the future
Description: 'The simple past in Dutch, as in many other European languages, is not
  necessarily used to refer to a past eventuality. A Dutch example of a verb in simple
  past that does not refer to a past event, taken from the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN),
  is: "Pa die ging morgen golfen" ‘Dad is going to play golf tomorrow.’ Here, the
  past tense verb ging ‘went’ can be called a ‘fake past’, since it refers to a future
  eventuality, as can be seen from the adverb tomorrow. We argue that this use of
  the past tense is not modal, because it does not involve reference to a counterfactual,
  hypothetical, or unlikely eventuality. We present a Reichenbachian (1947) analysis
  of this use of past tense, in which we argue that while the eventuality takes place
  in the future, past tense is used to indicate that the point of perspective (R)
  is situated in the past (i.e. R-S-E).'
