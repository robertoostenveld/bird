Title: Reading Minds, Reading Stories Data Set
Description: "This data set consists of eye-tracking data and various data related\
  \ to individual differences in social-cognitive abilities (self-reported trait empathy,\
  \ emotional empathy, perspective-taking abilities, spontaneous mentalizing tendencies),\
  \ personality traits (need for affect, need for cognition), and reading-related\
  \ characteristics (print exposure, story world absorption, reading motivation) from\
  \ 90 native speakers of Dutch who read a 5000-word non-fictional narrative that\
  \ has been coded for various lexical characteristics (frequency, word length, POS),\
  \ as well as the presence of viewpoint markers. \r\n\r\nThe data was collected to\
  \ study the relationship between social-cognitive abilities and the linguistic processing\
  \ of perceptual, cognitive, and emotional viewpoint markers, in the context of PhD\
  \ research by Lynn Eekhof, at the Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University."
