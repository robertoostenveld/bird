Title: A linguistic view on gender in medical interaction
Description: Women’s and men’s experiences of health, healthcare trajectories, and
  health outcomes often vary. Explanations for these differences go beyond biological
  sex, and attention for the effects of psychosocial gender on health has increased
  in the past few years. Yet, many aspects of gender and its multiple dimensions in
  health remain unclear, such as the role of gender in medical interaction. A focus
  on physicians’ and patients’ language use in consultations, and on how their language
  use is connected to gender, could increase our understanding of how gender impacts
  health and healthcare. This dissertation focuses on general practice consultations,
  which constitute an important stage in in the medical trajectory. By adopting a
  multi-method approach that explores the connection between gender and language use
  in medical interaction from various angles, I aim to provide a linguistic view on
  gender in interactions between GPs and patients with common somatic symptoms.
