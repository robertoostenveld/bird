Title: 'Unraveling interdisciplinarity: changing perspectives on interdisciplinary
  education, learning and learning outcomes'
Description: "To fully utilize the potential impact of interdisciplinary learning,\
  \ a better overview of the state of the research field, and empirical research into\
  \ the effects and learning outcomes of interdisciplinary learning is needed. \n\
  This project, therefore, aims to provide a detailed view on the current state of\
  \ empirical research into the learning outcomes and design of interdisciplinary\
  \ learning, and extend it by presenting empirical results from the interdisciplinary\
  \ minor ‘Healthcare communication, management and organization’. \n\nThis project\
  \ has 4 subprojects:\n1. The state of empirical evidence for interdisciplinary learning\
  \ outcomes in higher education: a systematic review;\n2. Intrdisciplinary learning\
  \ and education: Broadening students' perspectives on healthcare communication;\
  \ \n3. Interdisciplinary education affects student learning: a focus group study;\n\
  4. How to cross the line: design principles for interdisciplinary education. \n\n\
  The data of subprojects 1,2 and 4 are made available in this data collection. The\
  \ data of subproject 3 are available with open access from: https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-zpq-7a3c\
