Title: Variation in the processing of grammatical norm violations
Description: So far, processing studies on grammatical norm violations (GNVs) in Dutch
  (i.e., als ‘as’ in comparatives) have mainly focused on general differences between
  GNVs and their grammatical and ungrammatical counterparts. The present study is
  the first to also systematically investigate between-participant and between-construction
  variation in the processing of GNVs, using a self-paced reading task. Age and educational
  level were investigated as potential sources of between-participant variation, and
  between-construction variation was assessed by including three GNVs that vary in
  the amount of prescriptive attention they receive in society. Results indeed showed
  that the processing of GNVs was influenced by the age and educational level of participants.
  Moreover, different results were obtained for different norm violations. Based on
  these results, we conclude that it is very important to take into account differences
  between participants and constructions when studying the processing of GNVs.
