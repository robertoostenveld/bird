Title: VoxPopuli
Description: "This is a collection of the tweet ids of all tweets that were used in\
  \ the VoxPopuli project and the annotations that were done.\r\n\r\nTweets from TwiNL\
  \ were collected for the election days of the Dutch provincial/senate elections\
  \ of 2011, 2015 and 2019 and the parliamentary elections of 2012 and 2017 and of\
  \ the 25 days before each election day. The tweets ids of each year are stored in\
  \ compressed files for every hour, in a directory with the name of that year.\r\n\
  \r\nThe annotations are stored in a CSV file in the directory Annotations. \r\n\r\
  \nSee the dissertation for details."
