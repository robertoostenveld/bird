Description: "This dataset contains data for the article \"Low-temperature nitrogen-bearing\
  \ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation routes validated by infrared spectroscopy\"\
  . It includes the source data of several figures, i.e. the recorded experimental\
  \ and calculated IR spectra, and the results of quantum-chemical calculations as\
  \ log files.\r\nAbstract:\r\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant\
  \ in many regions of the Universe, representing a major reservoir for cosmic\r\n\
  carbon. However, their formation pathways in cold regions of space remain elusive.\
  \ Recent astronomical detections show\r\nthat current astrochemical models drastically\
  \ underestimate the abundance of aromatic molecules and suggest that additional\r\
  \nformation pathways such as ion–molecule reactions need to be considered. Here\
  \ we reveal efficient low-temperature formation\r\npathways towards nitrogen-containing\
  \ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via exothermic pyridine+ and acetylene ion–molecule\r\
  \nreactions. The experimental approach combines kinetics with spectroscopic probing\
  \ and unambiguously identifies key reaction\r\nintermediates and the final nitrogen-containing\
  \ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon product quinolizinium+, a structure that is\r\n\
  thought to contribute to the 6.2 μm interstellar emission feature. This study not\
  \ only provides competing formation pathways\r\nrelevant in the chemistry of the\
  \ interstellar medium and Titan's atmosphere, but also delivers information to verify\
  \ in-silico\r\npotential energy surfaces, astrochemical models and infrared observations."
