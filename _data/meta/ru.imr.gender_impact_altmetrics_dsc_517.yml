Title: 'Dataset for: Alternative metrics, traditional problems? Assessing gendered
  dynamics in the altmetrics of political science'
Description: "Dataset and replication files for \"Alternative metrics, traditional\
  \ problems? Assessing gendered dynamics in the altmetrics of political science\"\
  , published in European Political Science (2023). More detailed information in the\
  \ README file. Please refer to the methodology section of the published article\
  \ and the altmetric.py command file annotations for details.\r\n\r\nThe abstract\
  \ of the published article is below:\r\nAltmetrics are an emerging form of bibliometric\
  \ measurement that capture the online dimension of scholarly exchange. Against the\
  \ backdrop of both a higher education landscape increasingly focused on quantifying\
  \ research productivity and impact, as well as literature emphasising the need to\
  \ address gender bias in the discipline, we consider whether and how altmetrics\
  \ (re)produce gendered dynamics in political science. Using a novel dataset on the\
  \ Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) of political science research, we investigate\
  \ two questions: Do AAS vary by gender? And how do AAS relate to gendered social\
  \ media dynamics? We find that AAS reproduce gendered dynamics found in disciplinary\
  \ publication and citation practices. For example, journal articles authored exclusively\
  \ by female scholars score 27% lower on average than exclusively male-authored outputs.\
  \ However, men are also more likely to write articles with an AAS of zero. These\
  \ patterns are shaped by the presence of high-scoring male “superstars” whose research\
  \ attracts much online attention. Complementing existing scholarship, we show that\
  \ the AAS closely overlaps with virality dynamics on Twitter. We suggest that these\
  \ gendered dynamics may be hidden behind the seemingly neutral, technical character\
  \ of altmetrics, which is worrisome where they are used to evaluate scholarship."
