Title: The posterior parietal cortex and subjectively perceived confidence during
  memory retrieval
Description: Functional neuroimaging studies suggest a role for the left angular gyrus
  (AG) in processes related to memory recognition. However, results of neuropsychological
  and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have been inconclusive regarding
  the specific contribution of the AG in recollection, familiarity, and the subjective
  experience of memory. To obtain further insight into this issue, 20 healthy right-handed
  volunteers performed a memory task in a single-blind within-subject controlled TMS
  study. Neuronavigated inhibitory repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied over the left
  AG and the vertex in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Prior to rTMS participants
  were presented with a list of words. After rTMS participants were shown a second
  list of words and instructed to indicate if the word was already shown prior to
  rTMS (“old”) or was presented for the first time (“new”). In addition, subjectively
  perceived memory confidence was assessed. Results showed that recollection was unaffected
  following inhibitory left AG rTMS. In contrast, rTMS over the left AG improved both
  familiarity and the subjectively perceived confidence of participants that demonstrated
  low baseline memory recognition. Our study highlights the importance of taking into
  account individual differences in experimental designs involving noninvasive brain
  stimulation.
