Title: The electrophysiology of subjectively perceived memory confidence in relation
  to recollection and familiarity
Description: Subjectively perceived confidence is critically involved in distinguishing
  recollection from familiarity in episodic memory retrieval. However, the extent
  to which recollection and familiarity share similar electrophysiological processes
  associated with subjectively perceived memory confidence remains an open question.
  In addition, the role of memory encoding in subjectively perceived confidence during
  retrieval has not yet been investigated. To address these issues, an EEG study was
  performed in thirty healthy volunteers. During a memory task, participants encoded
  a subset of words while rating the words on pleasantness. Memory recognition and
  subjectively perceived confidence concerning these ‘old’ and additional ‘new’ words
  was tested. Results showed that during retrieval, correctly classifying an old item
  with high subjectively perceived confidence was associated with a parietal ERP and
  parietal theta power, while frontal theta activity was related to high-confident
  novelty processing. During the memory encoding phase, a parietal ERP and frontal
  theta oscillations were related to subsequent subjectively perceived memory confidence.
  Our findings provide the first evidence that subjectively perceived memory confidence
  is associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates during both memory encoding
  and retrieval.
