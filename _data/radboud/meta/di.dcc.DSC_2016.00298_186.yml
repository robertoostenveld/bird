Title: Vestibular modulation of visuomotor feedback gains in reaching
Description: Humans quickly and sophisticatedly correct their movements in response
  to changes in the world, such as when reaching to a target that abruptly changes
  its location. The vigor of these movement corrections is time-dependent, increasing
  if the time left to make the correction decreases, which can be explained by Optimal
  feedback control (OFC) theory as an increase of optimal feedback gains. It is unknown
  if corrections for changes in the world are as sophisticated under full-body motion.
  For successful visually-probed motor corrections during full-body motion not only
  the motion of the hand relative to the body needs to be taken into account, also
  the motion of the hand in the world should be considered, because their relative
  positions are changing. Here, in two experiments, we show that visuomotor feedback
  corrections in response to target jumps are more vigorous for faster passive full-body
  translational acceleration than for slower acceleration, suggesting that vestibular
  information modulates visuomotor feedback gains. Interestingly, these corrections
  do not demonstrate the time-dependent characteristics that body-stationary visuomotor
  feedback gains typically show, such that an Optimal feedback control model fell
  short to explain them. We further show that the vigor of corrections generally decreased
  over the course of trials within the experiment, as if the sensorimotor system adjusted
  its gains when learning to integrate the vestibular input into hand motor control.
