Title: New in, old out? Does learning a new language make you forget previously learned
  foreign languages?
Description: 'Anecdotal evidence suggests that learning a new foreign language (FL)
  makes you forget previously learned FLs. To seek empirical evidence for this claim,
  we tested whether learning words in a previously unknown L3 hampers subsequent retrieval
  of their L2 translation equivalents. In two experiments, Dutch native speakers with
  knowledge of English (L2), but not Spanish (L3), first completed an English vocabulary
  test, based on which 46 participant-specific, known English words were chosen. Half
  of those were then learned in Spanish. Finally, participants’ memory for all 46
  English words was probed again in a picture naming task. In Experiment 1, all tests
  took place within one session. In Experiment 2, we separated the English pre-test
  from Spanish learning by a day and manipulated the timing of the English post-test
  (immediately after learning vs. one day later). By separating the post-test from
  Spanish learning, we asked whether consolidation of the new Spanish words would
  increase their interference strength. We found significant main effects of interference
  in naming latencies and accuracy:     Participants were slower and less accurate
  to recall words in English for which they had learned Spanish translations compared
  to words for which they had not. Consolidation did not significantly affect these
  interference effects. Learning a new language thus indeed comes at the cost of subsequent
  retrieval ability in other FLs. Such interference effects set in immediately after
  learning and do not need time to emerge, even when the other FL has been known for
  a long time.'
