Title: Plan versus motion-referenced generalization of fast and slow processes in
  reach adaptation
Description: Generalization in motor learning refers to the transfer of a learned
  compensation to other relevant contexts. The generalization function is typically
  assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent
  studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning
  is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants,
  we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions
  to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present
  study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a
  validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives,
  each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is
  achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive
  process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced
  or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the
  overall generalization by the slow and fast process.  We tested 23 participants
  in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of
  five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short
  adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization
  was assessed in eleven movement directions relative to the trained target direction.
  Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced
  to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential
  weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants.
