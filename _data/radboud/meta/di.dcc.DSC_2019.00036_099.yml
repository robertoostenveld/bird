Title: The impact of error frequency on errorless and errorful learning of object
  locations using a novel paradigm
Description: Errorless learning (EL) is an approach in which errors are eliminated
  or reduced as much as possible while learning of new information or skills. In contrast,
  during trial-and-error - or errorful - learning (TEL) errors are not reduced and
  are often even promoted. There is a complex and conflicting pattern of evidence
  whether EL or TEL may result in better memory performance. One major confound in
  the extant literature is that most EL studies have not controlled for the number
  of errors made during TEL, resulting in a large variability in the amount of errors
  committed. This variability likely explains why studies on the cognitive underpinnings
  of EL and TEL have produced mixed findings. In this study, a novel object-location
  learning task was employed to examine EL and TEL in 30 healthy young adults. The
  number of errors was systematically manipulated, allowing us to investigate the
  impact of frequency of errors on learning outcome. The results showed that recall
  from memory was significantly better during EL. However, the number of errors made
  during TEL did not influence the performance in young adults. Altogether, our novel
  paradigm is promising for measuring EL and TEL, allowing for more accurate analyses
  to understand the impact of error frequency on a personâ€™s learning ability and style.
