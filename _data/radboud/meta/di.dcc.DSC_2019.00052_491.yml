Title: 'Body shape as a visual feature: Evidence from spatially-global attentional
  modulation in human visual cortex'
Description: "Raw fMRI data accompanying the NeuroImage 2022 paper. Information about\
  \ the structure of data acquisition (run types, etc.) can be found in the paper.\
  \ Processed data (to produce the figures in the paper and any further analysis)\
  \ can be found on OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HJ5VC\r\n\r\nFeature-based\
  \ attention modulates visual processing beyond the focus of spatial attention. Previous\
  \ work has reported such spatially-global effects for low-level features such as\
  \ color and orientation, as well as for faces. Here, using fMRI, we provide evidence\
  \ for spatially-global attentional modulation for human bodies. Participants were\
  \ cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images.\
  \ Two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but\
  \ were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses time-locked\
  \ to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses\
  \ evoked by body silhouettes were modulated by the participantsâ€™ top-down attentional\
  \ set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the\
  \ task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses\
  \ of the body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of the object-selective\
  \ visual cortex. Additional analyses showed that this modulation reflected response\
  \ gain rather than a bias induced by the cues, and that it reflected enhancement\
  \ of body responses rather than suppression of non-body responses. These findings\
  \ provide evidence for a spatially-global attention mechanism for body shapes, supporting\
  \ the rapid and parallel detection of conspecifics in our environment."
