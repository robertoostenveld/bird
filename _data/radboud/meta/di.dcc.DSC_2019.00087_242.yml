Title: Adults do not distinguish action intentions based on movement kinematics presented
  in naturalistic settings
Description: Predicting others’ actions is an essential part of acting in the social
  world. Action kinematics have been proposed to be a cue about others’ intentions.
  It is still an open question whether adults can use the kinematic information in
  naturalistic settings, when presented as a part of a richer visual scene than previously
  examined. We investigated adults’ intention perception from kinematics in naturalistic
  stimuli in two experiments. In experiment 1, thirty participants watched grasp-to-drink
  and grasp-to-place movements and identified the movement intention (to drink or
  to place), whilst their mouth-opening muscle activity was measured with electromyography
  (EMG) to examine participants’ motor simulation of the observed actions. We found
  anecdotal evidence that participants could correctly identify the intentions from
  the action kinematics, although we found no evidence for increased activation of
  their mylohyoid muscle during the observation of grasp-to-drink compared to grasp-to-place
  actions. In pre-registered experiment 2, fifty participants completed the same task
  online. With the increased statistical power, we found strong evidence that participants
  were not able to discriminate intentions based on movement kinematics. Together,
  our findings suggest that the role of action kinematics in intention perception
  is more complex than previously assumed. Although previous research indicates that
  under certain circumstances observers can perceive and act upon intention-specific
  kinematic information, perceptual differences in everyday scenes or the observers’
  ability to use kinematic information in more naturalistic scenes seems limited.
