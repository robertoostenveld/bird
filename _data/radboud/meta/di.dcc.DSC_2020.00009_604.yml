Title: Changes of mind in decision making
Description: "Preprocessed data & code belonging to the paper \"Muscular reflex gains\
  \ reflect changes of mind in reaching\"\n\nIn folder Data:\n- For each participant,\
  \ \n1. Participantxx_analysed.mat: A preprocessed MATLAB data file containing experimental\
  \ parameters, behavioral responses, reach trajectories, and preprocessed and trial-cut\
  \ EMG data.\n2. Participantxx_modelfit.mat: The parameters that came from the model\
  \ fitting procedure, as well as the cost (negative log likelihood) that this fit\
  \ had.\n3. Participantxx_startparams.mat: The eye-balled starting parameters used\
  \ for the fitting procedure.\n\n- RTable.csv: A table containing all participants'\
  \ single-trial coherence, viewing duration, chosen target, reflex magnitudes and\
  \ computed DVs. Meant to be read into R for statistical analysis.\n\nIn folder Code:\n\
  - S3_ModelFit.m and a function it depends on SimulatedForwardSim_CoMBias_6p.m: code\
  \ used to fit our drift diffusion model to each participants behavior, loads behavioral\
  \ data and starting parameters and runs the optimization.\n- S4_GrandAverageBehaviour.m\
  \ and a function it depends on ComputePRight.m: code used to generate figure 4,\
  \ reads in individual participant behavioral data & model fit parameters, calculates\
  \ the model predictions for each participants, computes a grand average of data\
  \ & model predictions and creates the plot.\n- S4_GrandAverageReflexes.m: code used\
  \ to generate figure 5, reads in individual participant reflex data, normalizes\
  \ it over participants, calculates a grand average & s.e.m. and creates the plot.\n\
  - S5_relateDVReflex.m and a function it depends on ComputeDV: code used to generate\
  \ figure 6 & 7, loads reflex activity and model fit parameters and determines DV\
  \ and normalized reflex magnitude on each trial before plotting their relationship.\
  \ Saves these values for the ROC analysis later.\n- S6_ROCAnalysis.m: code used\
  \ to generate figure 8, runs ROC analysis and performs t-test to compare the area\
  \ under the curve to 0.5.\n\n- CoM_LMM.R: R code containing the LMM we used for\
  \ statistical testing of the effect of evidence on the reflex magnitude.\n\nNB.\
  \ Please be aware that the model fits in the figures you create using this code\
  \ might differ slightly from those in the paper due to the simulated runs in the\
  \ model fitting procedure."
