Title: How infant-directed actions enhance infants’ attention, learning, and exploration
Description: When teaching infants new actions, parents tend to modify their movements.
  Infants prefer these infant-directed actions (IDAs) over adult-directed actions
  and learn well from them. Yet, it remains unclear how parents’ action modulations
  capture infants’ attention. Typically, making movements larger than usual is thought
  to draw attention. Recent findings, however, suggest that parents might exploit
  movement variability to highlight actions. We hypothesized that variability in movement
  amplitude rather than higher amplitude is capturing infants’ attention during IDAs.
  Using EEG, we measured 15-month-olds’ brain activity while they were observing action
  demonstrations with normal, high, or variable amplitude movements. Infants’ theta
  power (4-5Hz) in fronto-central channels was compared between conditions. Frontal
  theta was significantly higher, indicating stronger attentional engagement, in the
  variable compared to the other conditions. Computational modelling showed that infants’
  frontal theta power was predicted best by how surprising each movement was. Thus,
  surprise induced by variability in movements rather than large movements alone engages
  infants’ attention during IDAs. Infants with higher theta power for variable movements
  were more likely to perform actions successfully and to explore objects novel in
  the context of the given goal. This highlights the brain mechanisms by which IDAs
  enhance infants’ attention, learning, and exploration.
