Title: Nine-month-old infants update their predictive models of a changing environment
Description: "Abstract: Humans generate internal models of their environment to predict\
  \ events in the world. As the environments change, our brains adjust to these changes\
  \ by updating their internal models. Here, we investigated whether and how 9-month-old\
  \ infants differentially update their models to represent a dynamic environment.\
  \ Infants observed a predictable sequence of stimuli, which were interrupted by\
  \ two types of cues. Following the update cue, the pattern was altered, thus, infants\
  \ were expected to update their predictions for the upcoming stimuli. Because the\
  \ pattern remained the same after the no-update cue, no subsequent updating was\
  \ required. Infants showed an amplified negative central (Nc) response when the\
  \ predictable sequence was interrupted. Late components such as the PSW were also\
  \ evoked in response to unexpected stimuli; however, we found no evidence for a\
  \ differential response to the informational value of surprising cues at later stages\
  \ of processing. Infants rather learned that surprising cues always signal a change\
  \ in the environment that requires updating. Interestingly, infants responded with\
  \ an amplified neural response to the absence of an expected change, suggesting\
  \ a top-down modulation of early sensory processing in infants. Our findings corroborate\
  \ emerging evidence showing that infants build predictive models early in life.\r\
  \n\r\nParticipants: The dataset comprises 32-channel EEG recordings from 59 infants\
  \ that were 9-months old (M = 272.78 days, range: 251–289 days, 31 girls). All infants\
  \ were born full-term and had no indications of atypical development.\r\n\r\nStimuli\
  \ and study design: In the study, infants’ neural response to audio-visual stimuli\
  \ was measured. Stimuli consisted of cartoon images of bees with different colors,\
  \ and two shape images: a triangle and a circle. All image and audio files are available\
  \ in the data repository. The bee images were presented at one of eight locations\
  \ positioned on a circle around the center of the screen. The shape stimuli and\
  \ fixation cross images were presented at the center of the screen. Each image was\
  \ accompanied by a unique sound, and image-sound associations were counterbalanced\
  \ across participants."
