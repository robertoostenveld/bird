Title: A horizon for haptic perception
Description: The spatial limits of sensory acquisition (its sensory horizon) is a
  fundamental property of any sensorimotor system. In the present study, we sought
  to determine whether there is a sensory horizon for the human haptic modality. At
  first blush, it seems obvious that the haptic system is bounded by the space where
  the body can interact with the environment (e.g., the arm span). However, the human
  somatosensory system is exquisitely tuned to sensing with tools—blind-cane navigation
  being a classic example of this. The horizon of haptic perception therefore extends
  beyond body space, but to what extent is unknown. We first used neuromechanical
  modelling to determine the theoretical horizon, which we pinpointed as six meters.
  We then used a psychophysical localization paradigm to behaviorally confirm that
  humans can haptically localize objects using a six-meter rod. This finding underscores
  the incredibly flexibility of the brain’s sensorimotor representations, as they
  can be adapted to sense with an object many times longer than the user’s own body.
