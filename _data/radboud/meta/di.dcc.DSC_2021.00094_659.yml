Title: Behavioral assessment of the quality of speech reconstructions from intracranial
  neural activity
Description: 'The collection contains behavioral data for the manuscript "Direct Speech
  Reconstruction from Sensorimotor Brain Activity with Optimized Deep Learning Models".
  Behavioral data was collected from three experiments: a word recognition experiment
  (I), a speaker recognition experiment (II) and an audio quality assessment (III).
  The aim of the experiments was to collect human perceptual judgments of speech reconstructed
  from sensorimotor human brain activity.'
