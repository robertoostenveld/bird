Title: Constructing others’ beliefs from one’s own using medial frontal cortex
Description: Many daily choices are based on one’s own knowledge. However, when predicting
  other people’s behavior, we need to consider the differences between our knowledge
  and other people’s presumed knowledge. Social agents need a mechanism to use privileged
  information for their own behavior but exclude it from predictions of others. Using
  fMRI, we investigated the neural implementation of such social and personal  predictions
  by manipulating privileged and shared information. The medial frontal cortex appeared
  to have an important role in flexibly making decisions using privileged information
  for oneself or predicting others behavior. Specifically, we show that ventromedial
  prefrontal cortex tracked the state of the world independent of the type of decision
  (personal, social), whereas dorsomedial regions adjusted their frame of reference
  to the use of privileged or shared information. Sampling privileged evidence not
  available to the confederate also relied on specific interactions between TPJ and
  frontal pole.
