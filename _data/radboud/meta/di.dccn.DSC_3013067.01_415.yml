Title: Tracking the involuntary retrieval of unwanted memory in the human brain with
  functional MRI
Description: This study is a two-session fMRI experiment, with the 24 hours interval
  between two sessions. Day1 session consists of the familiarization phase, the study
  phase, and the immediate typing test. The Day2 session consists of the second typing
  test, the modulation phase, and the final memory test. Among these phases, the familiarization,
  modulation, and the final memory test phase were performed in the scanner, while
  the study phase and two typing tests were performed in the behavioural lab.
