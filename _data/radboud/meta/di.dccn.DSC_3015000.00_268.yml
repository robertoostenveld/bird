Title: 'Reproducescript: Reducing the efforts to create reproducible analysis code
  with FieldTrip'
Description: "The analysis of EEG and MEG data typically requires a lengthy and complicated\
  \ sequence of analysis steps, often requiring large amounts of computations, which\
  \ are ideally represented in analysis scripts. These scripts are often written by\
  \ researchers without formal training in computer science, resulting in the quality\
  \ and readability of these analysis scripts to be highly dependent on individual\
  \ coding expertise and style. Even though the computational outcomes and interpretation\
  \ of the results can be correct, the inconsistent style and quality of analysis\
  \ scripts make reviewing the details of the analysis difficult for other researchers\
  \ that are either involved in the study or not, and the quality of the scripts might\
  \ compromise the reproducibility of obtained results. This paper describes the design\
  \ and implementation of a strategy that allows complete reproduction of MATLAB-based\
  \ scripts without little extra efforts on behalf of the user, which we implemented\
  \ as part of the FieldTrip toolbox. Starting from the researchersâ€™ idiosyncratic\
  \ pipeline scripts, this new functionality allows researchers to automatically create\
  \ and publish standardized analysis pipeline scripts, along with all relevant intermediate\
  \ data. We demonstrate the functionality and validate its effectiveness by applying\
  \ it to the analysis of a recently published MEG study.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains\
  \ the data, the original code, and the reproduced code for demonstrating FieldTrip's\
  \ reproducescript functionality. The original and reproduced scripts for example\
  \ 1 and 2 are shared here, including the data for 4 subjects which originates from\
  \ the FieldTrip tutorials. Example 3 uses the code from Andersen (2018, https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00261),\
  \ which was forked to and copied from\_https://github.com/matsvanes/omission_frontiers\_\
  after commit 279650994ff9c5b9720e05fa052bdcd2101ad4d0. The raw data for example\
  \ 3 can be downloaded from\_https://zenodo.org/record/1134776."
