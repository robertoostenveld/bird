Title: Is attention spontaneously biased towards regularities? A direct replication
  and extension.
Description: 'In this pre-registered replication study, we reassessed the spontaneous
  bias of attention towards task-irrelevant statistical regularities reported by Zhao,
  Al-Aidroos, and Turk-Browne (Psychological Science, 24(5), 667–677, 2013) using
  a larger sample size. We additionally extended the study to investigate the potential
  role of learning, doubling the duration of the experiment to determine whether the
  attentional bias towards regularities is reduced with continued exposure. While
  we could not directly replicate Zhao et al.’s central findings, our results provide
  a conceptual replication: we found that performance on a visual search task was
  better in a location containing task-irrelevant statistical regularities, supporting
  their conclusion that attention is spontaneously biased towards regularities in
  the environment. We further found that the attentional bias effect diminished with
  continued exposure to the regularities. We conclude that the spontaneous bias of
  attention towards task-irrelevant regularities may be transient, and propose that
  learning of the regularities may play a key role in moderating attentional selection.'
