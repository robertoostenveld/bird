Title: Magnetoencephalography recordings reveal the neural mechanisms of auditory
  contributions to improved visual detection
Description: 'Sounds enhance the detection of visual stimuli while concurrently biasing
  an observer’s decisions. To investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie such
  multisensory interactions, we decoded time-resolved Signal Detection Theory sensitivity
  and criterion parameters from magneto-encephalographic recordings of participants
  that performed a visual detection task. We found that sounds improved visual detection
  sensitivity by enhancing the accumulation and maintenance of perceptual evidence
  over time. Meanwhile, criterion decoding analyses revealed that sounds induced brain
  activity patterns that resembled the patterns evoked by an actual visual stimulus.
  These two complementary mechanisms of audiovisual interplay differed in terms of
  their automaticity: Whereas the sound-induced enhancement in visual sensitivity
  depended on participants being actively engaged in a detection task, we found that
  sounds activated the visual cortex irrespective of task demands, potentially inducing
  visual illusory percepts. These results challenge the classical assumption that
  sound-induced increases in false alarms exclusively correspond to decision-level
  biases.'
