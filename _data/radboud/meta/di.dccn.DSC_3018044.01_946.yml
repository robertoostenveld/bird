Title: Successor-like representation guides the prediction of future events in human
  visual cortex and hippocampus
Description: Human agents build models of our visual environment, which enable them
  to anticipate upcoming visual events. However, little is known about the properties
  of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations
  take the form of a predictive map-like structure, the so-called successor representation.
  Here we used human fMRI to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1)
  and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the successor representation
  during visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal
  sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure
  to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (e.g., - B - -) resulted
  in V1 activation of the successor locations of the full sequence (e.g., C-D), but
  not at the predecessor locations (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations
  are skewed toward future states, in line with the successor representation. Similar
  results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, hippocampus developed a stimulus
  tuning that was sensitive to the temporal distance in sequence-space, with fading
  representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1 in contrast,
  showed a tuning profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus-space.
  Together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both
  visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin
  to the successor representation.
