Title: 'Enhancing reproducibility in developmental EEG research: BIDS, cluster-based
  permutation tests, and effect sizes'
Description: "Developmental research using electroencephalography (EEG) offers valuable\
  \ insights in brain processes early in life, but at the same time, applying this\
  \ sensitive technique to young children who are often non-compliant and have short\
  \ attention spans comes with pratical limitations. It is thus of particular importance\
  \ to optimally use the limited resources to advance our understanding of development\
  \ through reproducible and replicable research practices. Here, we describe methodological\
  \ approaches that help maximize the reproducibility of developmental EEG research.\
  \ We discuss how to transform EEG data into the standardized Brain Imaging Data\
  \ Structure (BIDS) which organizes data according to the FAIR data sharing principles.\
  \ We provide a tutorial on how to use cluster-based permutation testing to analyze\
  \ developmental EEG data. This versatile test statistic solves the multiple comparison\
  \ problem omnipresent in EEG analysis and thereby substantially decreases the risk\
  \ of reporting false discoveries. Finally, we describe how to quantify effect sizes,\
  \ in particular of cluster-based permutation results. Reporting effect sizes conveys\
  \ a findingâ€™s impact and robustness which in turn informs future research. To demonstrate\
  \ these methodological approaches to data organization, analysis and report, we\
  \ use a publicly accessible infant EEG dataset and provide a complete copy of the\
  \ analysis code.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains the results of the analysis and\
  \ a static copy of the analysis scripts. See also https://doi.org/10.34973/gvr3-6g88\
  \ for the raw data."
