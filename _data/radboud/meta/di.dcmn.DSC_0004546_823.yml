Title: Midfrontal theta phase coordinates behaviorally relevant brain computations
  during cognitive control
Description: 'Neural oscillations are thought to provide a cyclic time frame for orchestrating
  brain computations. Following this assumption, midfrontal theta oscillations have
  recently been proposed to temporally organize brain computations during conflict
  processing. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we show that brain-behavior
  relationships during conflict tasks are modulated according to the phase of ongoing
  endogenous midfrontal theta oscillations recorded by scalp EEG. We found reproducible
  results in two independent datasets, using two different conflict tasks: brain-behavior
  relationships (correlation between reaction time and theta power) were theta phase-dependent
  in a subject-specific manner, and these “behaviorally optimal” theta phases were
  also associated with fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta
  phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present regardless of the strength
  of conflict. Thus, these results provide empirical evidence that midfrontal theta
  oscillations are involved in cyclically orchestrating brain computations likely
  related to response execution during the tasks rather than purely related to conflict
  processing. More generally, this study supports the hypothesis that phase-based
  computation is an important mechanism giving rise to cognitive processing.'
