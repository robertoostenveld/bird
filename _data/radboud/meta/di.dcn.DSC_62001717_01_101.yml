Title: Sound Localization in Real-Time Vocoded Cochlear-Implant Simulations With Normal-Hearing
  Listeners
Description: "Bilateral cochlear-implant (CI) users and single-sided deaf listeners\
  \ with a CI are less effective at localizing sounds than\r\nnormal-hearing (NH)\
  \ listeners. This performance gap is due to the degradation of binaural and monaural\
  \ sound localization\r\ncues, caused by a combination of device-related and patient-related\
  \ issues. In this study, we targeted the device-related issues\r\nby measuring sound\
  \ localization performance of 11 NH listeners, listening to free-field stimuli processed\
  \ by a real-time CI\r\nvocoder. The use of a real-time vocoder is a new approach,\
  \ which enables testing in a free-field environment. For the NH\r\nlistening condition,\
  \ all listeners accurately and precisely localized sounds according to a linear\
  \ stimulusâ€“response relationship\r\nwith an optimal gain and a minimal bias both\
  \ in the azimuth and in the elevation directions. In contrast, when listening with\r\
  \nbilateral real-time vocoders, listeners tended to orient either to the left or\
  \ to the right in azimuth and were unable to\r\ndetermine sound source elevation.\
  \ When listening with an NH ear and a unilateral vocoder, localization was impoverished\
  \ on\r\nthe vocoder side but improved toward the NH side. Localization performance\
  \ was also reflected by systematic variations in\r\nreaction times across listening\
  \ conditions.We conclude that perturbation of interaural temporal cues, reduction\
  \ of interaural\r\nlevel cues, and removal of spectral pinna cues by the vocoder\
  \ impairs sound localization. Listeners seem to ignore cues that\r\nwere made unreliable\
  \ by the vocoder, leading to acute reweighting of available localization cues. We\
  \ discuss how current CI\r\nprocessors prevent CI users from localizing sounds in\
  \ everyday environments."
