Title: Simon task M/EEG data
Description: "Theta-band (∼6 Hz) rhythmic activity within and over the medial prefrontal\
  \ cortex (“midfrontal theta”) has been identified as a distinctive signature of\
  \ “response conflict,” the competition between multiple actions when only one action\
  \ is goal-relevant. Midfrontal theta is traditionally conceptualized and analyzed\
  \ under the assumption that it is a unitary signature of conflict that can be uniquely\
  \ identified at one electrode (typically FCz). Here we recorded simultaneous MEG\
  \ and EEG (total of 328 sensors) in nine human subjects (7 female) and applied a\
  \ feature-guided multivariate source-separation decomposition to determine whether\
  \ conflict-related midfrontal theta is a unitary or multidimensional feature of\
  \ the data. For each subject, a generalized eigendecomposition (GED) yielded spatial\
  \ filters (components) that maximized the ratio between theta and broadband activity.\
  \ Components were retained based on significance thresholding and midfrontal EEG\
  \ topography. All of the subjects individually exhibited multiple (mean 5.89, SD\
  \ 2.47) midfrontal components that contributed to sensor-level midfrontal theta\
  \ power during the task. Component signals were temporally uncorrelated and asynchronous,\
  \ suggesting that each midfrontal theta component was unique. Our findings call\
  \ into question the dominant notion that midfrontal theta represents a unitary process.\
  \ Instead, we suggest that midfrontal theta spans a multidimensional space, indicating\
  \ multiple origins, but can manifest as a single feature at the sensor level due\
  \ to signal mixing.\r\n\r\nAnalysis code accompanying this publication/dataset will\
  \ be made available at https://github.com/marrit-git/MEEG-multiple-theta-sources."
