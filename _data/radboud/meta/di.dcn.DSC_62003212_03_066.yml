Title: Automatic and non-automatic finger and leg movements measured with functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
Description: "This dataset includes the data of 24 participants performing automatic\
  \ and non-automatic finger tapping and foot stepping movements in a block design\
  \ measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). \r\n\r\nFor the finger\
  \ tapping tasks, participants needed to tap their right-hand fingers in the order\
  \ of a 12-digit sequence on a numeric keypad, with 1, 2, 3, and 4 representing the\
  \ index, middle, ring, and little finger, respectively. For the foot stepping tasks,\
  \ participants needed to step with their right foot on four floor pads in the order\
  \ of the same 12-digit sequence, with 1, 2, 3, and 4 representing a step in the\
  \ middle, to the front, to the back, and to the side, respectively. Two different\
  \ sequences of similar difficulty were learned (A:434141243212 and B:212321324241).\
  \ One of the two was practiced 7 days before the experiment for 5 minutes a day\
  \ each limb (considered the automatic sequences). The other sequence was only practiced\
  \ for 5 minutes on the day of the experiment (considered the non-automatic sequence).\
  \ Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to start learning either sequence A\
  \ or B in advance. Participants performed all four tasks under two conditions: either\
  \ with or without a dual-task. The dual-task entailed performing the sequence while\
  \ simultaneously counting the letter 'G' from a list of randomly appearing letters\
  \ on the screen.\r\n\r\nfNIRS data was sampled from a multichannel device (24 long\
  \ and 12 short separation channels) over the left primary motor cortex, the left\
  \ premotor cortex, the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the left\
  \ and right posterior parietal cortex.\r\n\r\nWhen using this dataset, please also\
