Title: Classifying sex and strain from mouse ultrasonic vocalizations using deep learning
Description: "Vocalizations are widely used for communication between animals. Mice\
  \ use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social\
  \ contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important,\
  \ however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain\
  \ this information.\r\n\tUsing deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of\
  \ the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%,\
  \ vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could\
  \ also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however,\
  \ be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, spectrogram-to-features\
  \ and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the\
  \ features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional\
  \ DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests\
  \ an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in\
  \ the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals\
  \ a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while\
  \ the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many\
  \ features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance\
  \ classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before.\r\
  \n\tIn summary, spectrotemporal differences between male and female USVs allow at\
  \ least their partial classification, which enables sexual recognition between mice\
  \ and automated attribution of USVs during analysis of social interactions."
