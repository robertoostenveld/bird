Title: An individual with hearing preservation and bimodal hearing using a cochlear
  implant and hearing aids has perturbed sound localization but preserved speech perception
Description: "This study describes sound localization and speech-recognition-in-noise\
  \ abilities of a cochlear-implant user with electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) in\
  \ one ear, and a hearing aid in the contralateral ear. This listener had low-frequency,\
  \ up to 250 Hz, residual hearing within the normal range in both ears. The objective\
  \ was to determine how hearing devices affect spatial hearing for an individual\
  \ with substantial unaided low-frequency residual hearing. \r\nSound-localization\
  \ performance was assessed for three sounds with different bandpass characteristics:\
  \ low center frequency (100-400 Hz), mid center frequency (500-1500 Hz) and high\
  \ frequency broad-band (500-20000 Hz) noise. Speech recognition was assessed with\
  \ the Dutch Matrix sentence test presented in noise. Tests were performed while\
  \ the listener used several on-off combinations of the devices. \r\nThe listener\
  \ localized low-center frequency sounds well in all hearing conditions, but mid-center\
  \ frequency and high frequency broadband sounds were localized well almost exclusively\
  \ in the completely unaided condition (mid-center frequency sounds were also localized\
  \ well with the EAS device alone). Speech recognition was best in the fully aided\
  \ condition with speech presented in the front and noise presented at either side.\
  \ Furthermore, there was no significant improvement in speech recognition with all\
  \ devices on, compared to when the listener used her cochlear implant only. \r\n\
  Hearing aids and cochlear implant impair high frequency spatial hearing due to improper\
  \ weighing of interaural time and level difference cues. The results reinforce the\
  \ notion that hearing symmetry is important for sound localization. The symmetry\
  \ is perturbed by the hearing devices for higher frequencies. Speech recognition\
  \ depends mainly on hearing through the cochlear implant and is not significantly\
  \ improved with the added information from hearing aids. A contralateral hearing\
  \ aid provides benefit when the noise is spatially separated from the speech. However,\
  \ this benefit is explained by the head shadow in that ear, rather than by an ability\
  \ to spatially segregate noise from speech, as sound localization was perturbed\
  \ with all devices in use."
