Title: 'Working it out: Can an acute exercise bout alleviate memory bias, rumination
  and negative mood?'
Description: "Although it is well known that exercise reduces depressive symptoms,\r\
  \nthe underlying psychological mechanisms remain unclear.\r\nThis experimental study\
  \ examined the acute effect of exercise on\r\nmood, and depressotypic memory bias\
  \ and state rumination. Trait\r\nrumination was tested as a possible moderator.\
  \ A sample of nonregular\r\nexercisers (N = 100) was randomized to exercise or rest.\r\
  \nAfter a negative mood induction, the exercise condition cycled for\r\n24 min at\
  \ moderate intensity, while the rest condition rested.\r\nNegative and overgeneral\
  \ memory bias, as well as positive and\r\nnegative affect were assessed after exercise/rest.\
  \ To capture the\r\nlingering of negative mood and state rumination, both were\r\
  \nassessed multiple times throughout the study. The exercise (as\r\ncompared to\
  \ rest) condition reported more positive affect.\r\nHowever, no differences were\
  \ found on overgeneral memory bias,\r\nas well as depression-specific mood or state\
  \ rumination measured\r\nthroughout the study. Interestingly, the exercise condition\
  \ showed\r\nmore negative memory bias at higher levels of rumination.\r\nIndividual\
  \ differences in trait rumination moderated the exercise\r\nâ€”memory bias relation,\
  \ such that exercise increased negative\r\nmemory bias at higher levels of rumination.\
  \ It is possible that longterm\r\nexercise protocols are necessary to change cognitive\
  \ processes\r\nrelated to depression."
