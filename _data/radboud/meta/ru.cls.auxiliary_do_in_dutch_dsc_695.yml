Title: The not so dummy auxiliary 'do' in Dutch
Description: The auxiliary doen ‘do’ in standard Dutch is usually described as ‘dummy’
  because it supposedly adds nothing substantial to the meaning of the sentence. We
  argue, however, that the auxiliary does have a function in the sentence, as a marker
  of either habitual or intentional aspect. In an online production experiment, we
  investigated the acceptability of the allegedly dummy auxiliary doen ‘do’
