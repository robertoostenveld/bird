Title: Can YOU make a difference?
Description: Directly addressing the consumer in advertisements has a positive impact
  on their perception of the product. Dutch, however, makes a distinction between
  a formal and an informal second person pronoun. If and how this distinction impacts
  consumers’ appreciation in and beyond advertising has not received much attention.
  Quantifying consumers’ appreciation in terms of the attitude towards the advertisement
  and towards the product, purchase intention, and price estimation, we show experimentally
  that customers’ attitude towards the advertisement receives higher scores when the
  informal pronoun is used than when its formal counterpart is.
