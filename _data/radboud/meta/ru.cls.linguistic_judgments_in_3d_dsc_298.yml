Title: Linguistic judgments in 3D
Description: 'Linguistic judgment experiments typically elicit judgments in terms
  of the acceptability or surface probability of a sentence. There is evidence that
  the dimension of the scale on which sentences are judged influences the outcome
  of the experiment, but to date this evidence is only limited. This is not a trivial
  matter, as the elicited judgment data are increasingly considered the basis for
  inferences about linguistic representation. The present study investigates whether
  the dimension of the scale influences judgments. Sentences are judged in one of
  three dimensions: acceptability, probability, or aesthetics. Two distinct sets of
  experimental items are tested; one with cases of stigmatized variation (violations
  of the prescriptive norm) and another with cases of non-stigmatized variation (middle-field
  scrambling) in Dutch. The results show that participants take into account the scale
  dimension, both in stigmatized and in non-stigmatized variation. The results for
  stigmatized variation reflect a certain degree of conscious reflection based on
  the judgment scale; the effects in non-stigmatized variation, by contrast, are only
  main effects of instruction without changes in the relative pattern of judgments
  between conditions. These findings corroborate the idea that linguistic judgments
  of non-stigmatized variation are not the result of introspection in the technical
  sense, but automatic, multi-dimensional responses to a stimulus.'
