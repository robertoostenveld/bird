Title: FINDER - Managing innovation in the networked organization
Description: |-
  Interview descriptions from employees within the firm Atos as well as partnered organizations concerning collaborative innovation strategies and processes enacted to modernize Atos' financial services portfolio. Due to proprietary topics discussed and that the release of raw data could potentially incur severe damage to individuals' careers, interview contents are broadly redacted and generalized. Readers however can contact the lead author for specific requests on the dataset (alt email for after lead author's time on project ends: prime@sjamesellis.com).

  This project (FINDER) has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813095.
