Title: FINDER - Alternative business models in digital ecosystems
Description: "The dataset was created as part of the FINDER project workstream #3\
  \ \"Alternative Business Models in Digital Ecosystems\". This project (FINDER) has\
  \ received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation\
  \ programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813095.\r\n\r\n\
  As such the project, and therefore the dataset, focuses on high-technology (high-tech)\
  \ as the driver of firms' transformation through digital change. This initial dataset,\
  \ which will be extended for the respective subprojects, captures the acquisitions\
  \ of deal-makers from high-tech industries. As acquisitions are a common way to\
  \ adjust a firm’s portfolio of business activities they can be used to initiate\
  \ change and generate growth. In total, this dataset includes 8.979 deals conducted\
  \ by 3.145 acquirers between 1995 until 2020.\r\n\r\nBesides the baseline deal-data\
  \ derived from Thomson Reuters SDC Platinum database, this set further includes\
  \ variables created by ourselves revolving around the transaction."
